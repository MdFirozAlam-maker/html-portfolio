<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Md Firoz Alam, and I am currently a student pursuing BSc IT in Semester 3. I have a strong interest in technology and web development. I am learning the basics of web development and creating simple websites using HTML.</p>
        
        <p>I enjoy exploring new technologies, and I'm particularly interested in cybersecurity. I like to solve problems, and coding allows me to think creatively and logically.</p>

        <p>In my free time, I like to read about the latest tech trends, play video games, or explore new programming languages. I am eager to continue learning and improve my skills in web development and other IT-related fields.</p>
